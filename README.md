# webMap

A small code origionally introduced to me by a Python course I was taking, I decided to apply the course again as a revision for my python skills 

The code will generate a Map using Folium, then will extract Coordinates of US volcanoes from a CSV, then it will add a marker for each one of the volcanoes, coloring the marker based on the elevation 

the code will then add another layer using GeoJson, and it will color the layer based on the population of each country

it will also allow you to view and hide layers using a layer controller
